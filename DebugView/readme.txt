and load 'ConvexDecomposition.sln'

Build with Visual Studio.

After it builds, but before it runs, launch the DebugView application.

DebugView is a remote debug visualization application.  ConvexDecomposition is a simple
console application to test V-HACD.  This application has not graphics code, it simply
connects remotely to the DebugView application and sends commands.

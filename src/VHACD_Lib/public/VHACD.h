// Changes for version 3.0 : April 17, 2020 : John W. Ratcliff mailto:jratcliffscarab@gmail.com
//
// * An optional callback method called 'NotifyVHACDComplete' was added to the IUserCallback interface.
// * This method is called when an asynchronous V-HACD operation is been completed. The application can
// * use this call back as a trigger to wake up the app to start processing the V-HACD results. The
// * original polled method 'IsReady' is still valid and can continue to be used.
//
// * Some code cleanup was done, removed obsolete OpenCL, OpenMP and SIMD code.
// * The purpose of this change was to make the code more vanilla C++ and to make it easier to maintain
// * Removed the obsolete tetrahedral 'mode' as the library currently only supports voxels.
// * Again this was to make the code base smaller and easier to maintain.
// *
// * A new optional virtual interface called 'IUserProfiler' was provided.
// * This allows the user to provide an optional profiling callback interface to assist in
// * diagnosing performance issues. This change was made by Danny Couture at Epic for the UE4 integration.
// * Some profiling macros were also declared in support of this feature.
// *
// * Another new optional virtual interface called 'IUserTaskRunner' was provided.
// * This interface is used to run logical 'tasks' in a background thread. If none is provided
// * then a default implementation using std::thread will be executed.
// * This change was made by Danny Couture at Epic to speed up the voxelization step.
// *
// * Some performance optimizations were made to the code. They include the following:
// *
// * During the voxelization step there was code to rotate every point in the source mesh.
// * However this feature was not actually being used, so it was removed to improve performance
// * during the voxelization stage.
// *
// * Optimizations made to the voxelization step by Danny Couture at Epic include:
// * -Fix a comparison bug in VHACD Volume::Voxelize causing the number of
// *   voxels to explode when x == y and z < x.
// * - Rewrite voxel flood fill algorithm toward cache friendliness and get
// *      rid of extra data structure causing high memory usage on large voxels.
// * - Make the data ordering in vhacdVolume GetVoxel more cache friendly
// *   toward loops iterating over(i, j, k) in that order.
// *
// * During the voxelization phase, the original implementation would attempt to voxelize the input mesh
// * multiple times until it hit some target number of voxels. This step was not needed, as the number of
// * of desired voxels implies a certain voxel resolution so instead it just does the voxelization step
// * in a single pass at the specified detail level.
// *
// * The final performance optimization was to unroll the ComputeACD step so it can be run in parallel.
// * A new helper class was introduced called 'SimpleJobSystem' which can run micro-tasks across multiple threads.
// * When computing the ACD (approximate convex decomposition) the code iterates through all input sub-meshes
// * and computes the concavity, the optimal splitting plane and, optionally, splits the input mesh by a plane.
// * This can happen hundreds of even thousands of times. The original code did this in a for loop using a single
// * thread. The change made was so that this operation could be done in parallel. Since this operation is extremely
// * memory bound, it only provides about a 2x performance improvement, but that is still twice as fast at least.
// * After the voxelization optimizations the ComputeACD step remained slowest part of V-HACD.
// *
// * A new feature was introduced called the 'FillMode'. By default V-HACD performs a flood fill operation after
// * the voxelization step to determine which voxels lie 'inside' the source mesh surface and which are 'outside'.
// * Most of the time this flood fill approach works fine. However, if the source mesh has a hole anywhere in it
// * it can result in no voxels being marked as 'inside the surface'.  When this happens the convex decomposition
// * will treat the mesh as being 'hollow' inside. A good example of this failure case is the Stanford bunny which
// * has a hole on the bottom.
// *
// * A new FillMode was introduced called 'RAYCAST_FILL' which can correct for this. If the FillMode is set to
// * 'RAYCAST_FILL' then rather than doing a flood fill, instead each voxel will be categorized by performing
// * a raycast in the six cardinal directions. If 3 or more of those raycasts hit the 'inside' of the source mesh
// * then that voxel will be marked as being 'inside'. This can correct for the edge case when the source mesh has
// * a voxel sized hole in it.
// *
// * Finally, there are some cases where you might actually want the source mesh to be treated as being a 'hollow'
// * object.  For certain types of simulations this is actually desirable. So, there is a new FillMode called
// * 'SURFACE_ONLY' which will not mark any voxel as being 'inside' which will treat any source mesh as being 'hollow'
// * inside and any deep recursion of the convex decomposition will converge towards the 'skin' of the object.
// * For example, here is a video clip showing a simulation of a torus, without any holes, as a hollow object.
// *     https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIOoWN4CDb4
// *
// * Finally an important bug fix is included with this update.
// * When using V-HACD by default, it works by converting the source mesh into a voxel grid and the performing
// * the convex decomposition relative to that voxelization. This has a number of benefits, both performance as
// * well as it greatly simplifies the plane splitting step vs. trying to perform a full CSG operation on an
// * arbitrary triangle mesh.
// *
// * However, one downside of doing this is that the resulting convex hulls suffer a loss of precision. Each
// * point in the final convex hull does not rest on the original source mesh but, instead, is based on the voxel
// * resolution. If you use extremely high voxel resolutions then this loss of precision is less of an issue but
// * using high voxel resolutions can make V-HACD run much more slowly.  If you use a low voxel resolution V-HACD
// * can run much more quickly but the output convex hull points will not be coplanar to the original source mesh
// * and can result in poor simulation behavior.
// *
// * To fix this a new option was introduced called 'm_projectHullVertices'. If th is bool is set to true then
// * as a final step each point on the convex hull output will be 'projected' onto the source mesh. In the previous
// * release of V-HACD this 'projection' was done by performing a raycast operation. However, it was discovered that
// * on some types of meshes this operation could fail producing completely bad convex hulls.
// *
// * This bug was fixed by switching to a 'closest point' algorithm instead of a raycast. A new code snippet was
// * introduced called 'aabbtree', originally written by Miles Macklin, that can compute the closest point on a triangle
// * mesh, within a radius, in a highly efficient manner.


// Changes for version 2.3
//
// m_gamma : Has been removed.  This used to control the error metric to merge convex hulls.  Now it uses the
// 'm_maxConvexHulls' value instead. m_maxConvexHulls : This is the maximum number of convex hulls to produce from the
// merge operation; replaces 'm_gamma'.
//
// Note that decomposition depth is no longer a user provided value.  It is now derived from the
// maximum number of hulls requested.
//
// As a convenience to the user, each convex hull produced now includes the volume of the hull as well as it's center.
//
// This version supports a convenience method to automatically make V-HACD run asynchronously in a background thread.
// To get a fully asynchronous version, call 'CreateVHACD_ASYNC' instead of 'CreateVHACD'.  You get the same interface
// however, now when computing convex hulls, it is no longer a blocking operation.  All callback messages are still
// returned in the application's thread so you don't need to worry about mutex locks or anything in that case. To tell
// if the operation is complete, the application should call 'IsReady'.  This will return true if the last approximation
// operation is complete and will dispatch any pending messages. If you call 'Compute' while a previous operation was
// still running, it will automatically cancel the last request and begin a new one.  To cancel a currently running
// approximation just call 'Cancel'.
